My name is Zdenek and I am a full-stack developer mostly writing Javascript and Python.

I also run the [Visualising Data London](https://visualisingdata.london/), host [Intro to AI workshops](https://introducing.ai/) and team lead design sprints for [Data4Change](https://data4chan.ge/).

Occasionally, I [write](https://medium.com/thinking-out-loud/prototyping-for-digital-rights-lobbying-9e011dccff24) and [speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FtrpEGQHzE) about my work. [See my resume](../zdenek-hynek-resume-2020.pdf).
